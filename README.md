# Exploring-Public-Responses-to-Government-COVID-19-Policies
The ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has challenged governments worldwide and approaches to combating the spread and maintaining livelihoods have ranged significantly. The study aims to contribute to a growing area of interest on modelling political discourse by investigating whether social media, specifically twitter, can be used to identify topics of discussion, and whether government can interpret those discourses in a way that can support policy decisions. Real-time public responses to these policies are a matter of interest as understanding attitudes expressed towards government approaches could be valuable to guiding better or more grounded solutions for large-scale policy issues. Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is used to identify topics of discussion alongside VADERâ€™s sentiment analyzer (Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning). To colour the investigation, text data from two different jurisdictions is used and examined side by side. The Oxford COVID-19 Government Response Tracker (OxCGRT) is also used to standardize policy discussions.
